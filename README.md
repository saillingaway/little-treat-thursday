 # Little Treat Thursdays 🧋🍰🍨
A little ice cream cone, a small slice of cake. Or the perfect cheese foam topping matcha boba. Little treats keep us all going and I wanted a simple way to look back at my favorites and remember fun times with friends.

### How to use it

I haven't gotten around to deploying this so it runs locally. Just clone, start the server and build the project, you may have to mess with the ports depending on your set up.
```
~$ npm start
~$ node server.js
```
It comes with a few little treats pre-loaded, if you want to wipe them, for now the only option is to delete the `database.sqlite folder`, `rm path/to/database.sqlite` works fine.

## What's Next
I'm adding dates, location, a couple other things including the ability to edit previously saved little treats. I'll also be deploying this to run on the cloud at some point.
